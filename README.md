# What is Wordle
Wordle is a word game, which recently got very popular and was added to NYT Games website. It is developed by Josh Wardle. You can find the original game [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However, you can only play it once a day.

Luckily, in this version of Wordle that you are going to be programming, you will be able to play as many times as you want in a day. Moreover, you will be allowed to see which words could potentially be the right answer. What is more, you will be using a bigger data set than the actual Wordle, which basically involves all the 5 letter words in a Scrabble dictionary.
